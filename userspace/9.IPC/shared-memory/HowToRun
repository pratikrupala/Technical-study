Steps to run program
Two executables named consumer and producer are generated.
First run consumer in background as shown below in example.
Then start producer and keep giving input. Give "done" as input to finish both the processes.

Example:

[root@localhost src]# ./consumer &
[1] 4236
[root@localhost src]# ./producer
Enter your input:hi
You have given: hi
Waiting for consumer to complete.
Enter your input:hello
You have given: hello
Waiting for consumer to complete.
Enter your input:world
You have given: world
Waiting for consumer to complete.
Enter your input:done
[root@localhost src]# You have given: done

[1]+  Done                    ./consumer
[root@localhost src]#
