Steps to run program
	This program contains two executable named producer and consumer. But user just needs to run producer.
Producer itself calls consumer internally.

	Producer writes some predefined string to pipe and consumer consumes that string and prints it.

Example:

[root@localhost pipe]# ./producer
Parent written to a pipe: Hello World
Consumer read: Hello World
[root@localhost pipe]#
